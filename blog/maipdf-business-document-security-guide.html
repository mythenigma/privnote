                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Why Businesses Need MaiPDF</h2>
                        <p>Modern businesses share thousands of documents daily: financial reports, strategic plans, client information, and confidential data. When these documents are shared through regular email or cloud storage, they create permanent records that can be accessed, forwarded, or compromised months or years later.</p>
                        <p><strong>MaiPDF self-destructing PDFs</strong> help businesses protect sensitive documents by ensuring they automatically delete after being viewed a set number of times. This reduces the risk of data breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.</p>

                        <div class="card bg-light my-5">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h3 class="card-title">Business Document Security Statistics</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">According to IBM's 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report, the average cost of a data breach is $4.45 million. Documents shared through regular channels create permanent exposure points. MaiPDF's self-destructing PDFs help reduce this risk by ensuring documents are automatically deleted after use.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. Open Count Limits</h3>

                        <p>Once the open count limit is reached, your business document is permanently deleted:</p>

                        </ul>

                            <li>Email notifications for each document open</li>
                            <li>Track access patterns and timing</li>
                            <li>Audit trail for compliance purposes</li>
