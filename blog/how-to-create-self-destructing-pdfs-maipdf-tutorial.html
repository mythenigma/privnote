                        <p>Regular PDFs can be downloaded, saved, forwarded, and accessed indefinitely. <strong>Self-destructing PDFs</strong> solve this problem by automatically deleting themselves after being viewed a set number of times or after a specific time period.</p>
                        <p><strong>MaiPDF</strong> is a specialized service that makes it easy to create <strong>self-destructing PDFs</strong> with advanced security features like open count limits and time-based expiration. This complete tutorial will walk you through the entire process.</p>

                                <h3 class="card-title">Why Self-Destructing PDFs Matter</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">According to recent security studies, 45% of data breaches involve documents that were shared but never properly secured or deleted. <strong>MaiPDF</strong> helps prevent this by ensuring PDFs automatically delete after reaching their access limits.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step-by-Step Tutorial: Creating Your First Self-Destructing PDF</h2>
                        
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 1: Prepare Your PDF Document</h3>
                        <p>Before using <strong>MaiPDF</strong>, make sure you have your PDF file ready:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your PDF should be in standard PDF format (.pdf)</li>
                            <li>Ensure the file size is reasonable (MaiPDF works best with files under 10MB)</li>
                            <li>Make sure the PDF contains the information you want to share securely</li>
                            <li>Consider if the document truly needs to be self-destructing (some documents should be permanently stored)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 2: Visit MaiPDF.com</h3>
                        <p>Open your web browser and navigate to <a href="https://maipdf.com" target="_blank">MaiPDF.com</a>. You don't need to create an account—<strong>MaiPDF</strong> works immediately without registration.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 3: Upload Your PDF</h3>
                        <p>Click the upload button on the <strong>MaiPDF</strong> homepage and select your PDF file. The service will securely process your document and prepare it for secure sharing.</p>
                        <p><strong>What happens during upload:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your PDF is encrypted for secure storage</li>
                            <li>A unique identifier is generated for your document</li>
                            <li>The file is prepared for self-destructing functionality</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 4: Set Open Count Limit</h3>
                        <p>This is the key feature of <strong>MaiPDF</strong>. Set how many times your PDF can be opened:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1 time</strong> – True self-destructing PDF (deletes after first view)</li>
                            <li><strong>2-5 times</strong> – Allow multiple authorized viewers</li>
                            <li><strong>5-10 times</strong> – For team reviews or board meetings</li>
                            <li><strong>Custom limit</strong> – Set any number up to 99,999,999</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>How it works:</strong> Each time someone opens the PDF link, it counts as one "open." Once the limit is reached, the PDF is permanently deleted and the link becomes invalid.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 5: Set Reading Session Duration</h3>
                        <p>In addition to open count limits, you can control how long each viewing session lasts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Minimum 30 seconds</strong> – Quick viewing for simple documents</li>
                            <li><strong>1-5 minutes</strong> – Standard reading time for most documents</li>
                            <li><strong>10-30 minutes</strong> – For detailed reports or contracts that need thorough review</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This ensures that even if someone opens the PDF, they have a limited time to view it before the session expires.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 6: Configure Additional Security (Optional)</h3>
                        <p><strong>MaiPDF</strong> offers additional security options:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Email Notifications</strong> – Get notified when your PDF is opened</li>
                            <li><strong>Password Protection</strong> – Add a password that recipients must enter before viewing</li>
                            <li><strong>Multiple Email Alerts</strong> – Send notifications to multiple email addresses</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 7: Generate Your Secure Link</h3>
                        <p>Click the "Generate Link" button, and <strong>MaiPDF</strong> will create a unique, secure link to your <strong>self-destructing PDF</strong>. This link is what you'll share with your recipients.</p>
                        <p><strong>Link format:</strong> The link will look like <code>https://maipdf.com/file/[unique-id]@pdf</code></p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 8: Share Your Self-Destructing PDF</h3>
                        <p>Copy the secure link and share it with your intended recipients through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Email</li>
                            <li>Text messages</li>
                            <li>Secure messaging apps</li>
                            <li>Project management tools</li>
                            <li>For maximum security, send the link through <strong>Privnote</strong> self-destructing notes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 9: Monitor Access (If Enabled)</h3>
                        <p>If you enabled email notifications, you'll receive alerts each time the PDF is opened. This helps you track:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How many times the PDF has been accessed</li>
                            <li>When it was last opened</li>
                            <li>When the open count limit is reached</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="alert alert-primary my-4">
                            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb me-2"></i> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For maximum security, combine <strong>MaiPDF</strong> with <strong>Privnote</strong>. Create your self-destructing PDF on MaiPDF, then send the link through a Privnote self-destructing note. This creates a double layer of protection.

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Understanding MaiPDF Features</h2>
                        
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Open Count Limit Explained</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>open count limit</strong> is the maximum number of times your PDF can be opened before it's automatically deleted. Here's how it works:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Open Count = 1</strong> – PDF deletes immediately after first view (true self-destructing)</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Count = 3</strong> – PDF can be opened 3 times total, then automatically deletes</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Count = 10</strong> – Allows 10 separate opens before deletion</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Each time someone clicks the link and the PDF loads, it counts as one open. Refreshing the page counts as another open.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Reading Session Duration</h3>
                        <p>The reading session duration controls how long each viewing session lasts (in seconds). This is separate from the open count limit:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Even if someone opens the PDF, they have limited time to view it</li>
                            <li>After the session expires, they would need to open it again (counting as another open)</li>
                            <li>This provides additional security beyond just open count limits</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Best Practices for Creating Self-Destructing PDFs</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Choose appropriate open count limits</strong> – Match the limit to the number of authorized viewers</li>
                            <li><strong>Set realistic session durations</strong> – Give recipients enough time to read but not unlimited access</li>
                            <li><strong>Use email notifications</strong> – Track when and how often your PDF is accessed</li>
                            <li><strong>Add password protection</strong> – For highly sensitive documents, require a password</li>
                            <li><strong>Share links securely</strong> – Use secure communication channels to share MaiPDF links</li>
                            <li><strong>Inform recipients</strong> – Let them know about open count limits so they don't waste opens</li>
                            <li><strong>Combine with Privnote</strong> – Send MaiPDF links through Privnote for double security</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Common Use Cases for Self-Destructing PDFs</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Confidential Business Reports</strong> – Share quarterly reports with open count limits</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal Documents</strong> – Send sensitive contracts that should be deleted after review</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial Statements</strong> – Distribute financial data with limited access</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical Records</strong> – Share patient information that must be deleted after viewing</li>
                            <li><strong>Research Data</strong> – Distribute confidential research findings with access controls</li>
                            <li><strong>Board Presentations</strong> – Share strategic plans with limited viewing access</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">PDF Won't Upload</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check file size (MaiPDF works best with files under 10MB)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Recipient Can't Open PDF</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check if the open count limit has been reached</li>

                            <li>Ensure the link was copied correctly</li>
                            <li>Check if password protection is enabled and password was shared</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">PDF Deleted Too Quickly</h3>
                        <ul>
