                        <p>Online dating has become the norm, with millions of people using dating apps and websites to meet potential partners. However, sharing personal information through dating platforms can leave you vulnerable to privacy breaches, stalking, or identity theft.</p>
                        <p><strong>Privnote self-destructing notes</strong> offer a safer way to share sensitive information when dating online. By using <strong>self-destructing messages</strong> that automatically delete after being read, you can protect your privacy while still getting to know someone.</p>

                                <h3 class="card-title">Dating Safety Statistics</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">According to recent studies, 53% of online daters have experienced some form of harassment, and 28% have had their personal information misused. Using Privnote for sensitive information sharing can help reduce these risks by ensuring your details don't linger in chat history.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How Privnote Protects Your Dating Privacy</h2>
                        <p>When you use <strong>Privnote</strong> for online dating, your <strong>self-destructing notes</strong> automatically delete after being read. This means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your phone number, address, or personal details don't stay in chat history</li>
                            <li>If someone screenshots your message, the original is still deleted</li>
                            <li>You can share information without creating permanent records</li>
                            <li>Your privacy is protected even if the dating app is compromised</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Safe Information Sharing Scenarios</h2>
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. Sharing Phone Numbers</h3>
                        <p>Instead of typing your phone number directly in the dating app chat, use <strong>Privnote</strong> to send it through a <strong>self-destructing note</strong>. Once they read it, the number is automatically deleted from the chat.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Sharing Social Media Handles</h3>
                        <p>When you're ready to connect on social media, share your Instagram or Twitter handle through <strong>Privnote</strong> so it doesn't stay in the dating app's message history.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. Sharing Location for First Meetup</h3>
                        <p>For your first in-person meeting, share the location details through <strong>Privnote</strong> with a short expiration time. This ensures the location information is automatically deleted after the meeting.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">4. Personal Information Exchange</h3>
                        <p>If you need to share personal details like your last name or workplace, use <strong>Privnote</strong> to ensure this information doesn't create a permanent record in the dating app.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Step-by-Step: Using Privnote for Dating Safety</h2>

                            <li>Type the sensitive information you want to share (phone number, address, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Set the note to "destroy after reading" for maximum privacy</li>
                            <li>Optionally add password protection for extra security</li>
                            <li>Copy the secure Privnote link</li>

                        </ol>
