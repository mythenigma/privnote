                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Why Educational Institutions Need Privnote</h2>
                        <p>Schools and universities handle sensitive student information, staff credentials, and administrative data across email, learning management systems, and communication platforms. Every message containing this information that remains in inboxes creates FERPA compliance risks and potential data exposure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Privnote self-destructing notes</strong> help educational institutions reduce their data footprint. By sending sensitive information through notes that automatically delete after being read, schools maintain operational efficiency without leaving permanent records that could violate student privacy regulations.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">FERPA requires schools to protect student education records. Privnote helps institutions follow the "minimum necessary" principle by ensuring sensitive information is automatically deleted after use, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to student data.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Key Use Cases for Educational Institutions</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Student Portal Resets</strong> – Provide temporary login credentials to students or parents without storing them in support tickets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Staff Credential Handoffs</strong> – Share system passwords between IT staff during maintenance or onboarding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parent Communication</strong> – Send sensitive updates about student progress that don't need permanent storage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vendor Access</strong> – Provide temporary credentials to educational technology vendors or contractors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emergency Procedures</strong> – Coordinate crisis response instructions without leaving them in email archives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Testing Security</strong> – Share exam access codes or secure testing instructions that should expire immediately.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Privnote Workflow for Schools</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Identify information that requires temporary transmission (passwords, access codes, one-time instructions).</li>
                            <li>Create a Privnote with "destroy after reading" enabled.</li>
                            <li>Set expiration to 1-24 hours depending on urgency.</li>
                            <li>Add password protection for student-identifiable information.</li>
                            <li>Send the Privnote link through your approved communication channel.</li>
                            <li>Share the password separately if password protection is enabled.</li>
                            <li>Document the transmission in your student information system (SIS) without including sensitive content.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">FERPA Compliance Best Practices</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Never use Privnote for official student records that must be retained per FERPA requirements.</li>
                            <li>Use Privnote only for temporary information like passwords or one-time access codes.</li>
                            <li>Always enable password protection when sharing any student-identifiable information.</li>
                            <li>Set short expiration times (1-4 hours) for student-related Privnote messages.</li>
                            <li>Document Privnote usage in your FERPA compliance logs without including the sensitive content.</li>
                            <li>Train staff on when to use Privnote versus official student record systems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Security Tips for Educational Institutions</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Require password protection for all Privnote messages containing student information.</li>
                            <li>Set expiration times to 1 hour or less for sensitive educational data.</li>
                            <li>Use dual-channel delivery (link in email, password via phone or secure SMS).</li>
                            <li>Train staff not to screenshot Privnote messages containing student data.</li>
                            <li>Combine Privnote with your existing student information system (SIS) for official records.</li>
                            <li>Regularly audit Privnote usage to ensure FERPA compliance.</li>
                        </ul>
