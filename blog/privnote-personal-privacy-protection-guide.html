                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Why Personal Privacy Matters in 2025</h2>
                        <p>In our digital age, every text message, email, and chat creates a permanent record of your personal life. From sharing passwords with family to sending sensitive information to friends, these digital trails can be accessed, hacked, or exposed years later.</p>
                        <p><strong>Privnote self-destructing notes</strong> help you protect your personal privacy by ensuring sensitive information automatically disappears after being read. Whether you're sharing passwords, personal details, or confidential information, Privnote ensures your private life stays private.</p>

                        <div class="card bg-light my-5">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h3 class="card-title">Privacy Statistics</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">A recent study found that 87% of people are concerned about their digital privacy, yet 73% still share sensitive information through regular text messages and emails. Privnote helps bridge this gap by providing a simple way to share information that automatically disappears.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Personal Privacy Use Cases</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Family Password Sharing</strong> – Share streaming service passwords, Wi-Fi credentials, or account logins with family members without leaving them in chat history.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Financial Information</strong> – Send bank account details, credit card information, or financial updates to trusted family members for one-time transactions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical Information</strong> – Share sensitive health updates or medical appointment details that don't need permanent storage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Documents</strong> – Send social security numbers, ID numbers, or other sensitive personal information for specific purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Relationship Communication</strong> – Share private thoughts, personal updates, or sensitive conversations that should remain confidential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Travel Plans</strong> – Send detailed travel itineraries, hotel confirmations, or emergency contact information without creating permanent records.</li>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How Privnote Protects Your Personal Privacy</h2>
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. Automatic Deletion</h3>
                        <p>When you use Privnote, your messages are automatically deleted after being read. This means your sensitive personal information doesn't stay in chat history, email accounts, or on servers where it could be discovered later.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. No Account Required</h3>
                        <p>Privnote doesn't require you to create an account or provide personal information. This means your identity isn't linked to your messages, providing an additional layer of privacy protection.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">3. One-Time Access</h3>
                        <p>Each Privnote can only be viewed once. Once the recipient opens and reads your message, it's permanently deleted and the link becomes invalid. This ensures your personal information can't be accessed multiple times or shared further.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">4. Password Protection</h3>
                        <p>For highly sensitive personal information, you can add password protection to your Privnote. This ensures that even if someone gets the link, they can't read your message without the password.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">5. Time-Based Expiration</h3>
                        <p>You can set Privnote messages to expire after a specific time period (1 hour, 24 hours, or 7 days). This ensures your personal information is automatically deleted even if it's not read, providing additional privacy protection.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Personal Privacy Best Practices</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use Privnote for any information you don't want to leave in chat history or email.</li>
                            <li>Always enable password protection for highly sensitive personal information like financial data or social security numbers.</li>
                            <li>Set short expiration times (1 hour) for very sensitive personal information.</li>
                            <li>Share Privnote passwords through a different communication channel (phone call, SMS) for maximum security.</li>
                            <li>Tell recipients to read Privnote messages immediately, as they can only be viewed once.</li>
                            <li>Never share Privnote links publicly or on social media.</li>
                            <li>Use Privnote in combination with other privacy tools for comprehensive protection.</li>
                        </ul>
