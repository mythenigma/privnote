                        <p>Families often need to share passwords for streaming services, Wi-Fi networks, online accounts, and more. While sharing passwords with family members is common, doing it through regular text messages or emails leaves these sensitive credentials in chat history forever, creating security risks.</p>
                        <p><strong>Privnote self-destructing notes</strong> solve this problem by allowing you to share passwords with family members securely. The password is automatically deleted after being read, ensuring it doesn't stay in anyone's phone or email account.</p>

                        <div class="card bg-light my-5">

                                <h3 class="card-title">Family Password Statistics</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">A recent survey found that 67% of families share at least one password, but only 23% do it securely. Most people still use unsafe methods like text messages, putting their accounts at risk if phones are lost or hacked.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How to Share Family Passwords with Privnote</h2>
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 1: Visit Privnote.chat</h3>
                        <p>Go to <a href="https://privnote.chat">Privnote.chat</a> in your web browser. No account is needed—you can start sharing immediately.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 2: Type the Password</h3>
                        <p>Enter the password or account information you want to share. You can include the username, password, and any additional instructions.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 3: Set to Destroy After Reading</h3>
                        <p>Choose "Destroy after reading" so the password is automatically deleted once your family member reads it.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 4: Add Password Protection (Optional)</h3>
                        <p>For extra security, add a Privnote password. Share this password separately (via phone call or in person) for maximum protection.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 5: Share the Secure Link</h3>
                        <p>Copy the Privnote link and send it to your family member through text, email, or any messaging app. Remind them to read it immediately.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 6: Confirm Receipt</h3>
                        <p>Ask your family member to confirm they received and can access the account. Once they've read the Privnote, it's automatically deleted.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Family Password Sharing Best Practices</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use Privnote for all password sharing with family members</li>
                            <li>Set passwords to "destroy after reading" for maximum security</li>
                            <li>Use password protection for highly sensitive accounts (banking, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Change passwords periodically, especially after sharing them</li>
                            <li>Only share with family members you trust completely</li>
                            <li>Consider using a password manager for long-term password storage</li>
                            <li>Don't share passwords for accounts that require individual access</li>
                        </ul>
