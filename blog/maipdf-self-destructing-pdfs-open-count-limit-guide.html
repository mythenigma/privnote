                        <p><strong>MaiPDF</strong> is a specialized service that allows you to create <strong>self-destructing PDFs</strong> with advanced security features. Unlike regular PDF sharing where documents can be downloaded, forwarded, and accessed indefinitely, <strong>MaiPDF</strong> enables you to share PDFs that automatically delete after being viewed a set number of times or after a specific time period.</p>
                        <p>With <strong>MaiPDF</strong>, you can set <strong>open count limits</strong> to control exactly how many times your PDF can be opened before it's automatically deleted. This makes it perfect for sharing confidential documents, contracts, reports, or any sensitive information that shouldn't be accessible indefinitely.</p>

                        <div class="card bg-light my-5">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h3 class="card-title">Why Self-Destructing PDFs Matter</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">According to recent studies, 68% of data breaches involve documents that were shared but never properly secured or deleted. <strong>MaiPDF</strong> solves this problem by ensuring PDFs automatically delete after reaching their <strong>open count limit</strong>, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive documents.</p>

                        </div>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Key Features of MaiPDF</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Open Count Limits</strong> – Set exactly how many times your PDF can be opened before it's deleted</li>
                            <li><strong>Time-Based Expiration</strong> – PDFs automatically expire after a set reading session duration</li>
                            <li><strong>Automatic Deletion</strong> – Documents are permanently deleted after reaching limits</li>
                            <li><strong>Secure Sharing</strong> – Generate secure links that can only be accessed a limited number of times</li>
                            <li><strong>Email Notifications</strong> – Get notified when your PDF is opened</li>
                            <li><strong>Password Protection</strong> – Add an extra layer of security to your PDFs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How MaiPDF Self-Destructing PDFs Work</h2>
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 1: Upload Your PDF</h3>
                        <p>Visit <a href="https://maipdf.com" target="_blank">MaiPDF.com</a> and upload your PDF document. The service supports standard PDF files and processes them securely.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 2: Set Open Count Limit</h3>
                        <p>This is the key feature of <strong>MaiPDF</strong>. You can set exactly how many times your PDF can be opened:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1 time</strong> – PDF deletes after being opened once (true self-destructing)</li>
                            <li><strong>2-5 times</strong> – Allow multiple authorized viewers before deletion</li>
                            <li><strong>Custom limit</strong> – Set any number up to 99,999,999 opens</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once the <strong>open count limit</strong> is reached, the PDF is permanently deleted and the link becomes invalid.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 3: Set Reading Session Duration</h3>
                        <p>In addition to <strong>open count limits</strong>, you can set how long each viewing session lasts (in seconds). This ensures that even if someone opens the PDF, they have a limited time to view it before it expires.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 4: Generate Secure Link</h3>
                        <p><strong>MaiPDF</strong> generates a unique, secure link to your PDF. This link can only be used up to the <strong>open count limit</strong> you've set.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 5: Share and Monitor</h3>
                        <p>Share the link with your intended recipients. You can optionally enable email notifications to know when the PDF is opened. Once the <strong>open count limit</strong> is reached, the PDF is automatically deleted.</p>

                        <div class="alert alert-primary my-4">
                            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb me-2"></i> <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> For maximum security, combine <strong>MaiPDF</strong> with <strong>Privnote</strong>. Send the MaiPDF link through a Privnote self-destructing note, creating a double layer of security where both the link and the PDF itself are protected.

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How to Use MaiPDF: Step-by-Step Tutorial</h2>
                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 1: Visit MaiPDF.com</h3>
                        <p>Go to <a href="https://maipdf.com" target="_blank">MaiPDF.com</a> in your web browser. No account creation is required to get started.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 2: Upload Your PDF</h3>
                        <p>Click the upload button and select the PDF file you want to share. <strong>MaiPDF</strong> will process your document securely.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 3: Configure Security Settings</h3>
                        <p>Set your security preferences:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Open Count Limit</strong> – Enter the number of times the PDF can be opened (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 10)</li>
                            <li><strong>Reading Session Duration</strong> – Set how long each viewing session lasts (in seconds, minimum 30 seconds)</li>
                            <li><strong>Password Protection</strong> (Optional) – Add a password for extra security</li>
                            <li><strong>Email Notifications</strong> (Optional) – Enter your email to receive notifications when the PDF is opened</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 4: Generate Your Secure Link</h3>
                        <p>Click "Generate Link" and <strong>MaiPDF</strong> will create a unique, secure link to your self-destructing PDF. This link will only work up to your specified <strong>open count limit</strong>.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 5: Share the Link</h3>
                        <p>Copy the secure link and share it with your intended recipients through email, messaging apps, or secure communication channels. For maximum security, consider sending the link through <strong>Privnote</strong> self-destructing notes.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Step 6: Monitor Access</h3>
                        <p>If you enabled email notifications, you'll receive alerts each time the PDF is opened. Once the <strong>open count limit</strong> is reached, the PDF is automatically deleted and the link becomes invalid.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Understanding Open Count Limits</h2>
                        <p>The <strong>open count limit</strong> is the maximum number of times your PDF can be opened before it's automatically deleted. Here's how it works:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Open Count = 1</strong> – True self-destructing PDF. Deletes immediately after first view.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Count = 3</strong> – PDF can be opened 3 times total, then automatically deletes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Count = 10</strong> – Allows 10 separate opens before deletion.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>

                            <li>Each time someone clicks the link and the PDF loads, it counts as one open</li>
                            <li>Refreshing the page counts as another open</li>
                            <li>Once the limit is reached, the PDF is permanently deleted</li>
                            <li>The link becomes invalid and cannot be used again</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Combining MaiPDF with Privnote for Maximum Security</h2>
                        <p>For the highest level of security, combine <strong>MaiPDF</strong> with <strong>Privnote</strong>:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create your self-destructing PDF on <strong>MaiPDF</strong> with your desired <strong>open count limit</strong></li>
                            <li>Copy the secure MaiPDF link</li>
                            <li>Create a Privnote self-destructing note containing the MaiPDF link</li>
                            <li>Share the Privnote link with your recipient</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This creates a double layer of protection: the Privnote link deletes after being read, and the MaiPDF document deletes after reaching its <strong>open count limit</strong>.</p>
