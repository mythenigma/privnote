                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">1. True Self-Destructing Messages</h3>
                        <p><strong>Why use Privnote?</strong> Because it offers true <strong>self-destructing notes</strong> that are permanently deleted immediately after being read. Unlike regular messaging apps where your messages stay in chat history forever, <strong>Privnote</strong> ensures your sensitive information disappears completely.</p>
                        
                        <p>When you use <strong>Privnote</strong> for <strong>secure messaging</strong>, your messages are automatically deleted from the server once the recipient opens them. This means no permanent record exists, protecting your privacy and sensitive information.</p>

                        <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">2. Completely Free with No Limits</h3>
                        <p>One of the best reasons <strong>why you should use Privnote</strong> is that it's 100% free. There are no subscription fees, no usage limits, and no hidden costs.

                        <p><strong>Privnote</strong> uses secure encryption protocols to protect your messages, ensuring that your sensitive information remains private and secure.</p>

                        <p>For extra security, <strong>Privnote</strong> allows you to add password protection to your <strong>self-destructing notes</strong>. This means even if someone gets the link, they can't read your message without the password.</p>
                        
                        <p>This feature makes <strong>Privnote</strong> ideal for highly sensitive <strong>secure messaging</strong> where you need an additional layer of protection.</p>
