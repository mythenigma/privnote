                            "I wanted to give my children access to my financial accounts in case of emergency, but I didn't want that information permanently accessible to their spouses or stored in their phones."

                        <p><strong>The Situation:</strong> Eleanor was updating her estate planning and wanted to ensure her adult children could access important accounts if she became incapacitated. However, she was concerned about permanent storage of sensitive financial information.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why Self-Destructing Messages:</strong> "I trust my children completely, but I wanted control over how long they had access to my account information. This way, they could write down what they needed and the digital record would disappear."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Result:</strong> Eleanor's children received the emergency financial information, stored it securely in their own systems, and felt confident they could help their mother if needed. Eleanor felt secure knowing the information wasn't permanently floating in digital space.</p>
