                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Why Financial Institutions Need Privnote</h2>
                        <p>Banks, credit unions, and fintech companies handle some of the most sensitive data in the economy: account numbers, routing codes, API keys, trading credentials, and customer PII. Every message containing this information that lingers in email or chat creates a compliance risk and a potential attack vector.</p>
                        <p><strong>Privnote self-destructing notes</strong> help financial teams reduce their exposure window. By sending sensitive information through notes that automatically delete after being read, institutions maintain operational speed without leaving permanent records that could be discovered in audits or breaches.</p>

                        <div class="card bg-light my-5">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h3 class="card-title">Financial Industry Risk</h3>
                                <p class="card-text">According to the 2024 Financial Services Threat Report, 78% of financial breaches involve compromised credentials. Privnote reduces credential exposure by ensuring passwords and access codes are deleted immediately after use, rather than sitting in email archives for years.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Key Use Cases for Financial Services</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>API Key Distribution</strong> – Share temporary API credentials with third-party vendors or partners without storing them in email.</li>
                            <li><strong>Customer Portal Resets</strong> – Provide one-time access codes to customers for account recovery without leaving traces in support tickets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Internal Credential Handoffs</strong> – Transfer system passwords between IT teams during maintenance windows.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trading Platform Access</strong> – Deliver temporary trading credentials to authorized personnel with automatic expiration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compliance Coordination</strong> – Share sensitive audit notes or regulatory updates that don't need permanent storage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vendor Onboarding</strong> – Provide temporary access to payment processors or data providers without creating long-term accounts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Privnote Workflow for Financial Teams</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Identify information that requires temporary transmission (passwords, access codes, one-time instructions).</li>
                            <li>Create a Privnote with "destroy after reading" enabled and set a short expiration (1-4 hours).</li>
                            <li>Add password protection for highly sensitive financial data.</li>
                            <li>Send the Privnote link through your secure communication channel.</li>
                            <li>Share the Privnote password via a separate channel (phone, secure pager, or encrypted SMS).</li>
                            <li>Document the transmission in your audit log without including the sensitive content.</li>
                            <li>Rotate credentials immediately after the Privnote is accessed.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Compliance Considerations</h2>
                        <p>While Privnote helps reduce data exposure, financial institutions must still comply with regulations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PCI DSS</strong> – Never use Privnote for full cardholder data. Use it only for access credentials or non-card data.</li>
                            <li><strong>SOX</strong> – Document that Privnote was used for transmission, but store official records in approved systems.</li>
                            <li><strong>GLBA</strong> – Ensure customer financial information shared via Privnote follows your privacy policy.</li>
                            <li><strong>FFIEC Guidelines</strong> – Use Privnote as part of a layered security approach, not as the sole security measure.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Security Best Practices for Financial Services</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always enable password protection when sharing financial credentials.</li>
                            <li>Set expiration times to 1 hour or less for sensitive financial data.</li>
                            <li>Use dual-channel delivery (link in email, password via phone).</li>
                            <li>Rotate all credentials immediately after Privnote delivery.</li>
                            <li>Log Privnote usage in your security information and event management (SIEM) system.</li>
                            <li>Train staff to never screenshot Privnote messages containing financial data.</li>
                            <li>Combine Privnote with multi-factor authentication for critical systems.</li>
                        </ul>
